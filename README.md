# Java Threads: Concept & Demonstration

## What are Threads in Java?

A **thread** in Java is a lightweight subprocess or the smallest unit of a CPU execution. Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple threads to run concurrently, making programs more efficient and responsive.

### Key Concepts

- **Multithreading**: Running multiple threads simultaneously.
- **Thread Class**: Java provides a `Thread` class to create and control threads.
- **Runnable Interface**: An alternative way to define the thread logic using the `Runnable` interface.
- **Thread Lifecycle**: A thread goes through several states: New → Runnable → Running → Blocked/Waiting → Terminated.
